            John von Neumann was born on December 28th 1903 in the Kingdom of Hungary, Budapest, from a well off family. He showed peculiar skills and interest in mathematics, languages, and technique. After elementary school, he attended the famous Fasori highschool, where he recieved an excellent education in history, law, and economics. His mathematical capabilities were discovered by Rátz László. He attended the Scientific University of Budapest, and later the Berlin University, and the Eidgenössiche Technische Hochschul university in Zürich.

          <p id="behuz">
            Neumann took part in weapons research during the fight against the nazis, where he participated in atomic research and it’s uses in the second World War. Afterwards, he took part in research for peacful uses of atomic energy.

            From 1945 to 1957, he was the director of the Electronic Computer project at Princeton. Neumann played a major role in the creation of the ENIAC computer, the world’s first electric and digital computer in 1944. He established the Neumann principles, which layed the groundwork for de development of IT. The EDSAC computer was the first computer based on Neumann’s principles.

            Neumann’s interest turned towards the inner workings of the brain and nervous system in the later part of his life. His efforts lead him to being appointed as the president of the USA Atomic Energy Committee by the President.

            In his last years, he suffered from prostate cancer, which according to some, he developed due to the radiation he absorbed during his time at Los Alamos. He wrote his last work in 1956, which was about computers. John von Neumann died on February 8th 1957, in Washington, at 53 years old.

            Neumann’s life work and contribution to the field of IT, mathematics, and technology left permanent marks, and significantly affected the evolution of modern computers.
