            Even at a young age, Neumann showed great intelectual capability. During his student years, he made acquaintances with great minds, like Wigner Jenő, Harsányi János, Fritz Haber, and Albert Einstein, many of whom he later work with on various projects.
          </p>
          <p id="behuz">
            In April of 1927, he applied as a teacher at Friedrich Wilhelm University, and started as a professor there on the 13th of December. Thanks to his education and experience, he was invited to work at Princeton university in the United States in 1929, where he went on to hold lectures untill 1931, switching betwee teaching in Europe and in America each semester. At Priceton, he did lectures about mathematical physics, and quantum physics. From 1933 to 1955, he worked as a professor at the newly opened Institute for Advanced Studies.

          <p id="behuz">
            In 1937, after gaining his US citizenship, he immediatley tried to enlist in the army as a lieutenant, but was rejected due to his age. In the late thirties he developed an interest in the mathematics of explosions, in this time period, he was the leading authority of the mathematics of shaped charges. Thanks to this, he often consulted for the US navy, and later lead to his envolvement in the Manhattan Project during World War II in Los Alamos. 
          </p>
          <p id="behuz">
            Neumann’s main contribution to the Manhattan Project was the shaped charge mechanism that compressed the bomb’s plutonium core. Besides that, he also helped in deciding the Japanese targets that the bomb would be dropped on, and the height at which the blast would kill the most people. Neumann was present at the Trinity bomb test.

            After the war, he became a consultant to the army, for example, he developed the strategy of mutually assured destruction.

            Neumann served as a consultant on the ENIAC and EDVAC projects. In 1945, he developed the merge sort algorithm. He worked on random number generation, and contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method. Stochastic computing was introduced by von Neumann in 1953. He wrote three programming languages for the ENIAC computer. While working on the ENIAC computer, he developed the Neumann principles, which are still used when making computers.          </p>

            Von Neumann founded the field of game theory as a maHe proved his minimax theorem in 1928. It establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information, there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses.          </p>

            While Neumann was doing research into the possible applications of computers, he became interested in weather prediction. He founded the „Meteorological Project” in 1946 at IAS. In 1950, Neumann and Jule Gregory Charney wrote the worlds first weather prediction software, and performed the world’s first numerical weather forecast on the ENIAC computer. In 1955, Neumann, based on data gathered by the ENIAC computer, observed that climate change has started.

            During his career, Neumann published over 150 scientific papers, around 60 of which were about pure mathematics, 60 about about applied mathematics, 20 about physics, and the rest were about special mathematic cases and non-mathematical topics. Besides his papers, he also published 10 books.
